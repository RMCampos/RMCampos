<h2>All right, if you're interested, here's a little bit more about myself</h2>

- I consider myself as an introverted person, but after talking for some minutes, we can become friends easily.
- I really like reading, mostly about adventures, science fiction and novels. Currently, I'm reading Christmas Carol.
- Nowadays I prefer movies rather than series, because I'm trying to have a more quiet life.
- For movies I like action, cars, love stories, and science fiction
- One movie: The Lords of The Ring
- One book: Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children
- Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio
- Actress: Jennifer Lawrence 
- Movie director: Martin Scorsese 
- And last but not least, I'm a cat person. But I also love dogs.
