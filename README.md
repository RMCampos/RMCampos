Hello! Welcome to my resume! I'm a Java developer, primarily focused on the Back-End, but I like a lot of Front-End too! Daily I'm working on a variety of services and technologies. Handling (and learning) a little bit of DevOps, CI/CD.

After working for almost eight-year primarily focused on Java and its ecosystem, I joined Daitan, an Encora Company, where I'm having the opportunity to work with several technologies, like AWS, micros-services, and functional programming languages.

# Interests
ðŸ¤“ In my free time, I often study English (pronunciation mostly), technologies and follow the community. Like most IT guys, I carry some stereotype, that includes: reading a lot (Find out more here), solving Rubik's Cube 3x3 and 4x4 at the work waiting for something, and movies. A bunch of movies!

ðŸ’š When I'm offline I spend most of my time with my wife. We like to watch movies (see?) and shows together, go out and discover new places, specially cafe bar (I'm a avid coffee lover and its variations).

ðŸŽ¸ Apart from TV and coffee, I love to cook, and try new recipes. I'm also a musician, I play some (mostly Brazilians) instruments, like Mandolim (a 8 string instrument, largely used for MPB and Choro genres), cavaquinho (4 string instrument, very used in Samba genre), a little bit of acoustic guitar, and now I'm learning how to play drums.
