Hello! Welcome to my resume! In a nutshell, I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer, who likes very much of Java and its ecosystem and now is deep-diving into the React world! At my current position, I'm working with micro-services mostly in Java and React.

My current job, since August 2021, is at [Encora Brazil - Former Daitan Labs](https://daitan.com/), where I'm having the opportunity to work on incredible projects with several technologies, including Amazon AWS Cloud, micros-services, BFF, and functional programming language like Clojure.

# Interests

ðŸ¤“ In my free time, I often study English (pronunciation mostly), technologies and follow the community. Like most IT guys, I carry some stereotype, that includes: reading a lot, solving Rubik's Cube 3x3 and 4x4 at the work waiting for something, and movies. A bunch of movies!

ðŸ’š When I'm offline I spend most of my time with my wife. We like to watch movies (see?) and shows together, go out and discover new places, specially cafe bar (I'm a avid coffee lover and its variations).

ðŸŽ¸ Apart from TV and coffee, I love to cook, and try new recipes. I'm also a musician, I play some (mostly Brazilians) instruments, like Mandolim (a 8 string instrument, largely used for MPB and Choro genres), cavaquinho (4 string instrument, very used in Samba genre), a little bit of acoustic guitar, and now I'm learning how to play drums.
